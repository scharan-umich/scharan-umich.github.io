            <p>
                My name is Saicharan Vemuri. I am currently studying Computer Science at the Unversity of Michigan College of Engineering. I am also pursuing a Minor in the Japanese language.
                In the vast field of Computer Science, my main interests include game development, server and system administration, and cybersecurity. My work experience and courseload supplement this to give me hands-on knowledge of how these fields work in the industry.
                My extracurricular interests inlclude music creation and performance (and listening, of course), video games, technological advancements in computing, and whatever I come across that piques a passion of mine.
                Overall, I love learning about new things, improving my skills, following my passions, and creating new things!
